# hello-world

This will be only the start of my programming journey into a job of web development. 
Using "The Odin Project", I will learn the necessary skills and knowledge needed to acheive my goal of becoming a full-time web developer.
Throughout the curriculum, hopefully I learn to push through hardships I may encounter on the way. Use this as an inspiration for myself to keep learning.
